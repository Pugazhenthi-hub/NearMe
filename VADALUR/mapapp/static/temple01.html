            The Sathya Gnana Sabhai in Vadalur is a spiritual center founded by the Tamil saint Ramalinga Adigalar (Vallalar) in 1872, symbolizing the "Hall of True Wisdom". Designed in an octagonal shape, it is not a traditional temple as it has no idols and prohibits animal sacrifice or flower offerings; instead, it focuses on worshiping the divine light (Arutperunjothi). A key feature is the central lamp, which represents the divine light, with seven colored veils before it symbolizing the obstacles to spiritual enlightenment that must be removed. 
Structure and symbolism
Shape: The building is octagonal, representing a lotus, and has windows and doors.
Inner Mandapam: A central area features a lamp and a mirror that reflects its light.
Seven Veils: Seven cotton screens in front of the light represent the seven factors that veil the soul from realizing its true nature. 
Spiritual significance
Focus on Light: The central theme is the worship of light, which symbolizes the divine grace and wisdom sought by the saint.
Secular and Universal: It was established as a secular space open to all castes, with only those who ate meat being restricted from entering the inner shrine.
Compassion and Service: The center promotes the saint's teachings of universal love and compassion (Jeevakarunyam), and the nearby Sathya Dharma Salai continues to serve the poor. 
Key features
Perpetual Lamp: The lamp was lit by Vallalar on January 25, 1872, and is kept perpetually burning.
Jyothi Darshan: On the Thaipoosa festival day, Jyothi darshan (viewing of the light) is performed six times throughout the day.
