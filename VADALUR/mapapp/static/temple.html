            In the ancient temple courtyard, there are shrines for Karuppannasamy, a flagpole, and a horse chariot. People from Cuddalore, Panruti, and Elumedu visit this temple before any auspicious ceremony in their homes to seek the goddess’s blessings and approval. Devotees place a lemon on the shoulder of the goddess’s idol and silently pray for success in their upcoming endeavor. It is a firm belief among the devotees that if the lemon falls down, the undertaking will be successful.

Since Pachai Vazhiyamman is considered a guardian deity, a unique feature of this temple is that during worship, devotees perform rituals accompanied by the sounds of the silambu (anklet) and udukku (a traditional drum), which are believed to be the deity’s favorite instruments. People come here seeking blessings for marriage, as well as for the reunion of separated couples. Devotees whose wishes are fulfilled offer a green saree (pachai pudavai) to the goddess as a token of gratitude. During the Tamil month of Aadi, festivals are celebrated on Aadi Fridays and Aadi Amavasai (new moon day) in honor of the goddess.
