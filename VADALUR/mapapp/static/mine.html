            Neyveli is a major source of lignite in India, with a discovery in 1934 leading to the establishment of NLC India Limited (formerly Neyveli Lignite Corporation) in 1956 for its mining and power generation. The company operates open-cast mines, uses advanced German technology like bucket-wheel excavators for mining, and has linked them to thermal power stations, making it a leading energy provider in the country. 
Discovery and development
The lignite deposits were discovered by chance in 1934 and the area was later confirmed to have massive reserves.
This led to the formation of Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) in 1956, which was established to exploit these resources.
The first lignite seam was noticed in 1961, and regular mining began in 1962. 
Mining operations
NLC India Limited operates several open-cast mines in Neyveli and Barsingsar, with an annual capacity of 30.6 million tonnes.
The company uses advanced German technology, including bucket-wheel excavators, to extract the lignite.
The overburden removed from the mines is used for land reclamation and afforestation efforts. 
Power generation
The lignite is primarily used to generate electricity at pithead thermal power stations.
NLC has multiple thermal power plants with a significant total capacity, some of which are fueled by its own lignite mines.
The corporation also has a coal-based thermal power station through a joint venture. 
Economic and social impact
Neyveli has become an industrially important town, also known as "Powercity," due to its lignite and power generation activities.
NLC India Limited is a significant economic contributor and has diversified its operations to include other social welfare activities.
The company also has plans for future expansion in both lignite and coal mining and power generation.
